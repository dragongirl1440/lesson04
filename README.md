Worked through lesson files from Eve Porcello's LinkedIn Learning tutorial on ReactJS.  All rights go to her: https://www.linkedin.com/in/eveporcello/

1. Open Visual Studio in the start folder and run 'npm' to ensure all dependencies are installed.
2. Change directories to 'hello-react' and run 'npm start'.
3. Swap out code in 'index.js' depending on the functions you would like the application to perform in development mode.  Functions include the following:


-Listing arrays
-Documenting props
-Utilizing useEffect and useState
-Logging user input in the console

Please note that code is very primitive.
